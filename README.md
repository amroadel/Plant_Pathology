# Plant_Pathology
A project for Classification of Apple-leaf diseases for FGVC8 Plant Pathology
The problem statement is to classify the leaf images to decide if they have a disease or not. The proposed solution combines computer
vision techniques with deep learning to better approach the problem. The
computer vision part is mainly applying filters and realistic transforms to
the images to better help the deep learning model generalize and avoid
overfitting. 
Our proposed deep learning architecture is based on EfficientNet as a backbone.
